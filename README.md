# READ THIS - Following Along and Coding With the N+1 Videos? #

**Make sure you read the stuff below about how to create a new PCL in 2014+**.

The first 43 videos in the N+1 series (`N=0 through N=42`) were recorded before the `Portable Class Library (PCL)` approach was officially completed and released [by Xamarin as part of their Microsoft partnership](http://blog.xamarin.com/microsoft-and-xamarin-partner-globally/).

Before that time, Stuart would always select "`.NET Framework 4.5`, `Silverlight 4 and higher`, `Windows Phone 7.5 and higher`, `.NET for Windows Store apps`, and his manually created `Mono for Android` and `MonoTouch`" options when he was creating a new PCL in the videos.  These selections resulted in what is known by Microsoft as "`PCL Profile 104`".

The great news is that PCL support has been officially released by Xamarin and cross-platform PCL goodness without manually linking tons of files or using workarounds is now a reality!  We now know which "PCL profiles" are supported by Xamarin and the PCL creation dialog has official options of `Xamarin.Android` and `Xamarin.iOS` after you install the Xamarin tools (no manual XML hacks, etc. are needed anymore to get these non-MS platform options in the PCL dialog box).

Unfortunately, `PCL Profile 104` (which was used in the first 43 videos) is NOT supported out-of-the-box by Xamarin (for various reasons).  `PCL Profile 158` is supported however, and it is very similar to profile 104.  This PCL profile change basically drops support for Silverlight 4 and Windows Phone 7.5).  `MvvmCross` released its `3.1.n versions`, and updated the code in this N+1 repository, to switch everything to the Xamarin-supported `PCL Profile 158`.

If you are following along and coding with the first 43 videos in 2014+, you are likely installing MvvmCross version 3.1.n or later from NuGet.  This means that you should create your PCLs in a slightly different way to make sure they result in `PCL Profile 158` instead of the profile 104 ones that you seen in the first 43 videos.
 
To create a new PCL that results in the supported `Profile 158`, you now select the "`.NET Framework 4.5`, `Silverlight 5`, `Windows Phone 8`, `.NET for Windows Store apps`, `Xamarin.Android`, and `Xamarin.iOS` options when you create your PCL.  These selections result in what as known by Microsoft as "`PCL Profile 158`".

Enjoy the new seamless cross-platform code-sharing experience!
